Anonymous Email Script by Sandeep Das
Description:

This Python script, created by web developer Sandeep Das, enables users to send anonymous emails via the Anonymouse.org service. The script provides a simple command-line interface for inputting the recipient's email, subject, and message.



Usage:

Execute the script in a terminal.
Enter the recipient's email (to), subject (subject), and compose the email message (message).
The script utilizes predefined user agent and session settings for the HTTP request.
An HTTP POST request is made to Anonymouse.org, incorporating the provided information.
Upon successful email transmission, a success message is displayed, along with a note about possible random delays, up to 12 hours, for privacy enhancement.
Dependencies:

The script relies on the requests library. If not installed, use pip install requests.
Disclaimer:

Caution should be exercised when automating website interactions, especially with anonymous services, as it may violate terms of service. Consider the legal and ethical implications associated with such activities.
